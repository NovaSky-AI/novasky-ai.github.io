title: "SkyRL-v0: Train Real-World Long-Horizon Agents via Reinforcement Learning"
slug: skyrl-v0
description: "Most existing RL frameworks are optimized for tasks that involve stateless interactions over short horizons, such as search-augmented reasoning or simple code execution. In contrast, real-world tasks, like those represented in SWE-Bench, benefit from long-horizon planning in stateful, dynamic environments. This presents new challenges in both infrastructure and training algorithms. We introduce **SkyRL**, the first open-source online RL training framework for multi-turn tool use LLMs, optimized for long-horizon, real-environment tasks like SWE-Bench. Using SkyRL, we are able to achieve promising results on SWE-Bench-Verified across model lines!"
