title: "SkyRL-SQL: Simple and Data Efficient Multi-Turn RL for Text2SQL"
slug: skyrl-v0
description: "Recent advances in RL have turned LLMs into interactive agents capable of reasoning, exploring, and executing actions. While tasks like math, web search, kernel code generation have seen progress, database interaction remains under-explored. We are excited to release SkyRL-SQL, a simple and data-efficient multi-turn RL training pipeline for text-to-SQL task. Using just 653 training samples, our trained model SkyRL-SQL-7B can improve accuracy by up to 8.7% compared to the base model, outperforming GPT-4o, o4-mini, and open-source SFT model trained on 2.5 million samples."
